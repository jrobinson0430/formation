/*

Convert a non-negative integer to its equivalent representation as words in English.

Example

For num = 1, the output should be
solution(num) = "One";
For num = 123, the output should be
solution(num) = "One Hundred Twenty Three";
For num = 12345, the output should be
solution(num) = "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five";
For num = 1234567, the output should be
solution(num) = "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven".

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ num ≤ 231 - 1.
