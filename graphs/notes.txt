different ways to represent a graph.

// typically what you will get during interviews. vertex/edge list
vertices: [1,2,3,4,5]
edges: [[1,2],[1,3],[3,1],[3,4],[4,5],[4,2]]
Node ID to row index in matrix: {"1":0,"2":1,"3":2,"4":3,"5":4}

Adjacency Matrix:
0,1,1,0,0 
0,0,0,0,0 
1,0,0,1,0 
0,1,0,0,1 
0,0,0,0,0 

(1, [2,3])
(2, [])
(3, [1,4])
(4, [5,2])
(5, [])

Vertex List: [1,2,3,4]
Edge List: [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Adjacency List:  { '1': [ 2, 3 ], '2': [], '3': [ 4 ], '4': [] }
