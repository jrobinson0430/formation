❓ PROMPT
A bug in the Formation session tool accidentally duplicated some Fellows in sessions. Given an array of names representing Fellows in a session, return an array of the distinct Fellows. The array must be in the same order as the input.

Follow-up question:
How would removing the Fellows in place, instead of using a new output array, affect the algorithm's runtime?

Example(s)
["oliver", "pixel", "oliver", "pinky"] => ["oliver", "pixel", "pinky"]
 

🔎 EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
 if we start from the end of the array we can remove the duplicates as we go, but that will effect the order of fellows in the array.
